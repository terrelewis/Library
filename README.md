Introduction:
Library Management System is a software which will enable the user to manage the catalog of a library. This helps to keep the records of whole transactions of the books available in the library.
The software system allows the librarian to login into the system and manage the database of books. The admin can check details and remove faulty entries. The system also maintains a database of the books borrowed and the details of the borrower. The system provides a convenient way of keeping track of the books issued and the books available.
